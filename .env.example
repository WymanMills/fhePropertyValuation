# Replace with actual pauser addresses
# These addresses have the ability to pause the contract in emergencies

PAUSER_ADDRESS_1=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

# For production deployments with multiple KMS nodes:
# PAUSER_ADDRESS_2=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
# PAUSER_ADDRESS_3=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

# ============================================
# IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES
# ============================================
# 1. NEVER commit your actual .env file to version control
# 2. Keep your private keys secure and never share them
# 3. Use separate wallets for testnet and mainnet
# 4. Verify all addresses before deployment
# 5. Ensure pauser addresses are from trusted KMS/coprocessor nodes
# 6. Regularly rotate KMS_GENERATION for key management
# 7. Monitor gas reports to detect potential DoS attacks
# 8. Keep NUM_PAUSERS under 20 to prevent array-based DoS
# 9. Review security audit reports before production deployment
# 10. Enable REPORT_GAS during testing to optimize gas costs

# These settings are managed by package.json scripts
# - npm run lint:security    # Run security analysis
# - npm run size-check       # Check contract sizes
# - npm run gas-report       # Generate gas usage report
# - npm run security:check   # Run full security audit
# - npm run ci               # Run CI pipeline locally
